# Task Automation Script

## Objective
Develop a beginner-level Python script for task automation to streamline repetitive tasks. This script is designed to be customizable and can be adapted to perform various actions based on user needs.

## Key Features
1. **User Interaction:** Utilize input statements for user-defined tasks and parameters.
2. **File Operations:** Incorporate file handling operations for tasks like renaming, moving, or deleting files.
3. **Automation Logic:** Implement logic for repetitive actions based on user input (e.g., renaming files, resizing images, sorting files).
4. **Logging:** Integrate logging to keep a record of executed tasks, providing feedback on the script's execution.

## Technologies
- **Python:** Use Python as the primary scripting language.
- **VS Code:** Recommended IDE for project development.

## Instructions
1. Set up a new Python script in VS Code.
2. Use input statements to gather user preferences for automation tasks.
3. Implement efficient logic to carry out specified tasks.
4. Utilize functions to modularize code and enhance readability.
5. Add error handling for graceful management of unexpected scenarios.
6. Integrate the logging module to create a log file tracking tasks performed.

## Benefits
- Gain experience with user input and automation logic.
- Learn file operations and error handling in Python.
- Create a useful tool to save time and effort in everyday tasks.

Feel free to customize the project based on your preferences and add additional features as you become more comfortable with the concepts. This project provides a solid foundation for future automation and script development.
